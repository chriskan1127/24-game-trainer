# 24-Game Multiplayer Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document breaks down the implementation of the 24-game multiplayer system into atomic, independently buildable components. The system architecture leverages FastAPI + WebSockets for the server and adapts the existing Kivy single-player client for multiplayer functionality.

## System Architecture Overview

The multiplayer system consists of **8 server-side components**, **7 client-side components**, and **3 shared components** that work together to provide synchronized competitive gameplay for up to 4 players per room.

## Atomic System Components

### üåê Server-Side Components

#### 1. **WebSocket Server (FastAPI)**
**Purpose**: Handle real-time WebSocket connections and route messages  
**Dependencies**: FastAPI, WebSockets, Pydantic schemas  
**Key Responsibilities**:
- Accept WebSocket connections from clients
- Parse incoming JSON messages into Pydantic models
- Route messages to appropriate service handlers
- Manage connection lifecycle (connect/disconnect/error handling)
- Send responses back to clients

**API Contract**: 
- Accepts: `IncomingWSMessage` union (room.create, room.join, game.start, answer.submit)
- Sends: `OutgoingWSMessage` union (room.created, round.start, answer.ack, etc.)

#### 2. **Room Manager**
**Purpose**: Create, manage, and destroy game rooms  
**Dependencies**: Pydantic Room model, Problem Pool Service  
**Key Responsibilities**:
- Generate unique 4-character room codes
- Handle room creation with host assignment
- Manage player joining (max 4 players, duplicate username checks)
- Track room states (LOBBY ‚Üí RUNNING ‚Üí FINISHED)
- Initialize games with 10 pre-selected problems
- Handle room cleanup when empty

**Data Structures**:
- `rooms: Dict[RoomCode, Room]` - Active rooms registry
- Room state transitions and validation rules
- Host privileges and room locking mechanism

#### 3. **Game State Manager**
**Purpose**: Control game flow, round progression, and timing  
**Dependencies**: Timer Service, Message Broadcaster, Room Manager  
**Key Responsibilities**:
- Start games when host triggers (validate room has players)
- Manage round phases: COUNTDOWN (3s) ‚Üí ACTIVE (30s) ‚Üí RESULTS (6s)  
- Track current round index (0-9 for 10 rounds)
- Coordinate transitions between rounds
- Determine game end conditions and trigger final scoring

**State Transitions**:
```
LOBBY ‚Üí [host starts] ‚Üí COUNTDOWN ‚Üí ACTIVE ‚Üí RESULTS ‚Üí COUNTDOWN (next) ‚Üí ... ‚Üí FINISHED
```

#### 4. **Player Manager**
**Purpose**: Handle player authentication, scoring, and session management  
**Dependencies**: Room Manager  
**Key Responsibilities**:
- Generate and validate session tokens for players
- Track player scores and streaks within rooms
- Handle player reconnection using room code + username
- Maintain player state (connected/disconnected/last_seen)
- Calculate final leaderboards and rankings

**Player Lifecycle**:
- Join ‚Üí Authenticate ‚Üí Play ‚Üí Disconnect/Reconnect ‚Üí Leave
- Score tracking: base points (10) + speed bonus (0-5) per correct submission
- One submission per player per round limitation

#### 5. **Problem Pool Service**

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Generate 10 unique, solvable problems per game dynamically
- Ensure no duplicate problems within a single game (by number multiset)
- Provide problem metadata (numbers, problem_id, canonical solution)
- Use existing solver to validate each generated problem has a solution

**Problem Generation Strategy**:
- Generate problems on-demand when rooms are created
- For each game, iteratively generate working problems until 10 unique ones found
- Deduplication is per-game (not global) to maximize variety across games
- Use single-player solver's "best" solution logic for canonical solutions

#### 6. **Submission Processor**
**Purpose**: Validate and score player answer submissions  
**Dependencies**: Player Manager, 24-Game Solver  
**Key Responsibilities**:

- Log all submissions for debugging and anti-cheat analysis
- Update player scores in real-time

**Scoring Algorithm**:
```python
base_points = 10 if correct else 0
speed_bonus = ceil((time_left / 30.0) * 5) if correct else 0
total_points = base_points + speed_bonus
```

#### 7. **Message Broadcaster**
**Purpose**: Send synchronized messages to all players in a room  
**Dependencies**: WebSocket Server  
**Key Responsibilities**:
